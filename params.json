{"name":"GROMACS Tutorials","tagline":"Some GROMACS tutorials using methane and water","body":"Some [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org) tutorials for beginners. It's not\r\nnecessary to do the tutorials in order, but the first two\r\ntutorials are essential before going on to the others, as the structure file\r\n(`methane.pdb`) and topology file (`topol.top`) for methane from tutorial 2 are\r\nused in all subsequent tutorials. The tutorials are designed for GROMACS version\r\n5.1. If you are using an older version, some of the commands or parameters may\r\nhave changed. Note especially that the pull code for umbrella sampling has\r\nchanged since 5.0 and older releases.\r\n\r\nI assume you have some working knowledge of the command line. Specifically, you\r\nshould know how to make directories, change into them, and edit text files. When\r\nyou see a `$` or `>` this is the prompt on the commandline and indicates you\r\nshould type the text following it. Obviously I also assume you have GROMACS\r\ninstalled on a machine available to you.\r\n\r\nThroughout the tutorials we'll be using OPLS methane and TIP4PEW water.\r\n\r\n##Contents\r\n\r\n1. [Water](https://github.com/wesbarnett/gromacs-tutorials/blob/master/1_tip4pew_water/README.md) - Basics of setting up a simulation. Find out the\r\n   density of TIP4PEW water.\r\n2. [One methane in water](https://github.com/wesbarnett/gromacs-tutorials/blob/master/2_methane_in_water/README.md) - How to create a topology file\r\n   for a molecule and solvate it. Get the radial distribution function.\r\n3. [Several methanes in water](https://github.com/wesbarnett/gromacs-tutorials/blob/master/3_methanes_in_water/README.md) - How to put multiple\r\n   solutes into a system. Get the methane-methane potential of mean force.\r\n4. [Free energy of solvation of methane](https://github.com/wesbarnett/gromacs-tutorials/blob/master/4_methane_fe/README.md) - How to do a free energy\r\n   simulation when coupling a molecule. Use MBAR to get the result.\r\n5. [Umbrella sampling](https://github.com/wesbarnett/gromacs-tutorials/blob/master/5_umbrella/README.md) - Get methane-methane PMF from umbrella sampling using pull\r\n   code.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\nSome of the other software that I use in these tutorials that you may find\r\nuseful are:\r\n\r\n* [alchemical-analysis](https://github.com/MobleyLab/alchemical-analysis)\r\n* [Avogadro](http://avogadro.cc/wiki/Main_Page)\r\n* [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)\r\n* [vmd](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-66330449-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
