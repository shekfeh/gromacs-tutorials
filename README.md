#GROMACS Tutorials

Some [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org) tutorials for beginners. Each tutorial
builds off of the previous, so it is recommended to do them in order. This is a
work-in-progress.

I assume you have some working knowledge of the command line. Specifically, you
should know how to make directories, change into them, and edit text files.
Obviously I also assume you have GROMACS installed on a machine available to you.
